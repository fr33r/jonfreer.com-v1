						News story about our accomplishment on making it to Tier One Nationals.

						Up to this point in my hockey life, I had worked my way up from recreational
						league hockey from when I was 12 or so, to AA travel hockey. I continuously
						pushed myself to be the best I could be, and I played as much hockey as I 
						possibly could.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						The AAA Columbus Blue Jackets is the only AAA hockey organization in Columbus. AAA hockey in Ohio 
						is the highest intensity level that a player can reach, as well as the highest
						compitition. Making it to this level of play demonstrated that you had a high
						potential to move on to play juniors and/or college hockey.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						After trying out several years and not being chosen, I entered Nationwide Arena in
						2008 with ever high focus and intensity for the tryouts. These tryouts were always
						nerve wrecking for me because at this level of play, a lot of politics come into the
						picture. It was basically a given that members of the team the previous year had a
						pass to be on the team next year, so there were always limited spots to compete for.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						After a great tryout, I beat out thirteen other goaltenders for the one spot available 
						on the team. My hockey dreams had finally come true, and I could say that I had 
						become one of the elite hockey players in Columbus.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Our team made our way to Tier One Nationals in Saint Louis, Missouri after winning Regionals. This
						was the first time in orginization history and it was incredible to have been a part of that. Our accomplishment
						was even honored during the National Anthem at a Blue Jackets game, with all of us lined up on the blue line. 
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Although, I didn't get to play in Nationals as much as I would have wanted, I still look at it as an amazing event
						in my life. To say that we were one of sixteen teams in the United States to compete in Nationals is 
						truly amazing, and something few can say.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Many of the players on my team went on to be successful. Two of them have even gone on to be drafted to the NHL.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						The most important take away from this experience was actually me. A bit odd to say I know, but it was incredible
						how far I had come in one year. My agility on the ice was honed, my sight for the puck as well as 
						situations unfolding on the ice were sharp, and my competitiveness was at an all time high. I was the best I could be.
						I am still proud of that.
