						Near the end of high school, I began to feel the 
						pressure from my friends to attend The Ohio
						State University (OSU). Most of those who grow up in
						the Columbus area attend OSU. 
					</p>	
					<p class = "contentText">
						However, I had gained interest in Miami University,
						which is located in the small town of Oxford, Ohio. I had
						played several hockey tournaments at Miami over the years and 
						I had always liked the parts of campus that I was exposed
						to. 
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">	
						When it came to making a decision, I had both the papers
						signed for OSU and Miami. Last minute, I chose to take a 
						another visit to Miami to validate what I truly wanted. 
						There was no question after this. I wanted to be a Redhawk.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">	
						This was one the best decisions of my life. Every year I went
						back to school loving the places and the people I was surrounded
						by even more. I even loved the education more and more as the
						years went on.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">	
						In the four years I spent there, I made lifelong friendships,
						joined a great fraternity, met my beautiful girlfriend, received
						the best education I could ask for, and had a whole lot of fun
						in between.
