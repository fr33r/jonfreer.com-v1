						In the winter of my junior year at Miami, I interviewed for an Australian 
						company called Suncorp. After multiple rounds of interviews
						over the web, I received an offer for a ten week summer internship. 
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						The internship was based on Miami's campus in Benton Hall, where the college
						of engineering and computing resided. Majority of our communication was
						done over the web with various employees in Sydney, Australia, including the 
						Suncorp Business Services CEO, Jeff Smith, who also attended Miami University.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						I was excited as this was my first opportunity to apply the concepts I 
						had learned in the classroom for a business need. It helped me get an idea
						of where my skills matched up with others, while still having the comfort of
						working in a familiar environment.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Suncorp actively practices and promotes the Agile SDLC and have even applied its
						concepts towards many of its business processes. I underwent nearly 20 hours of
						Agile workshops before the internship started to get acquainted with the SDLC.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Suncorp left it to us to determine a project that would benefit Suncorp's business
						needs rather than assigning us a project. After much research and many presentations
						to Suncorp employees, we chose to produce a safe driving application that we
						later named Safe Driving Mate (SDM).
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						SDM was developed in an IDE called Xamarin, a cross-platform IDE that was 
						capable of compiling C# into Objective-C making it possible to develop iOS
						applications without any Objective-C knowledge. At first, our team had attempted
						to learn Objective-C with the hopes of creating the app in the iOS native language.
						However, the task became more daunting as no student from Miami at this time
						had received Objective-C lessons from a curriculum. Xamarin was recommended to
						us by the current employees of Suncorp as it was the tool of choice for them.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						The internship provided us with knowledge of how to develop software in a team 
						setting, as well as how to showcase and prepare a product for a client. By the tenth
						week, we had produced a fully functional application that alerted drivers when they
						had made sharp turns, hard stops, or excessive starts. The user could view the past
						trips, earn badges and points, and even post their success on Facebook for all
						of their friends to see. We completed a hand-off to Suncorp of the app and they
						stated that after review, they planned to launch the app to the iOS app store.
