						During my senior year at Miami, I started the search for my first full-time
						job. With Emma in Minneapolis waiting for me, I dedicated all of the time and
						effort I had into finding a job that suited my interests, and could also
						give me the ticket to the life I wanted in Minneapolis with Emma.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						After many interviews and several offers from different
						companies, I chose to join TATA Consultancy Services (TCS). 
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						I had two interviews; one on Miami's campus and one at the TCS Global Delivery
						Center (GDC) in Milford, Ohio. Both of the inteviews went well, and I still remember
						the impression I had when I walked into the GDC. 
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						On June 9th, 2014, my six week long Initial Learning Program (ILP) begun
						at the GDC in Milford. I learned more than I ever thought I could during ILP. I received extensive 
						technical training in realm of web applications. During this training, I learned the most important 
						concepts of HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, Java, and using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to interact with Oracle SQL databases.
						We used Eclipse, an IDE that I had become very familiar with in college, as our primary IDE.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						During ILP, we were assigned the task to aid a non-profit organization with a technical task or need.
						I chose to lead a team of five to help the Boys and Girls club of Fitchburg and Leominster. Their need
						was a completely redesigned website as theirs was very outdated. Our team produced a deliverable of
						five designs for their five most crucial pages. The Boys and Girls Club of Fitchburg and Leominster was
						so satisfied, we were nominated as the best group for the ILP non-profit project.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						On July 18th, I graduated ILP with a class rank of Excellent Performer and walked out the GDC doors bound
						for Minneapolis, Minnesota to work for my first client.
