					<p class = "contentText">
						Up to this point in my hockey life, I had worked my way up from recreational
						league hockey from when I was 12 or so, to AA travel hockey. I continuously
						pushed myself to be the best I could be, and I played as much hockey as I 
						possibly could.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						The AAA Columbus Blue Jackets is the only AAA hockey organization in Columbus. AAA hockey in Ohio 
						is the highest intensity level that a player can reach, as well as the highest
						compitition. Making it to this level of play demonstrated that you had a high
						potential to move on to play juniors and/or college hockey.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						After trying out several years and not being chosen, I entered Nationwide Arena in
						2008 with ever high focus and intensity for the tryouts. These tryouts were always
						nerve wrecking for me because at this level of play, a lot of politics come into the
						picture. It was basically a given that members of the team the previous year had a
						pass to be on the team next year, so there were always limited spots to compete for.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						After a great tryout, I beat out thirteen other goaltenders for the one spot available 
						on the team. My hockey dreams had finally come true, and I could say that I had 
						become one of the elite hockey players in Columbus.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						We made our way around the country; anywhere from Blaine, Minnesota to Plano, Texas. We
						played the best teams in the country and even beat some of them. I was shown everything 
						that hockey was in the United States.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">	
						I learned a lot this year. A lot about myself. A lot about other people. A lot about 
						coaches. A lot about handling situations. I thought that when I had made the team that
						the hardest part was over. I didn't think about the hardships that
						came along with this level of play.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Remember, it was my first year in the organization. I was practically an outsider. The 
						team I had made was the U16 AAA Blue Jackets, a merge between the 1992 and 1993 birth years.
						Out of the two groups, I didn't really fit into either since they had
						formed based on their respective teams the year(s) before.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						However, I had a good start to the season. I played relatively well for never playing at the
						intensity before, and had some moments where I impressed my teammates, coaches, and those
						who watched me.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Near the middle of the season, my coaches made a decision to alter the equal time
						split between me and the other goaltender on the team. They made sure that I knew that it was
						not due to my performance, and I remember at times that they actually praised my performance
						before following with another statement that I would not be playing the next game.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						I felt my drive dip for the first time in my life. I had worked so hard to be there, perfected
						many areas of my play that the coaches had set out for me to improve, and always gave every game my all.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						I started to realize why this was happening and the coaches were right, it had nothing to do 
						with my play. Politics had its way of twisting things up, and unfortunately I was the only one
						impacted.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Despite this, I still made my way between the pipes fairly often and proved that I was still
						worthy of the spot. I had parents of other teams come up to me and tell me how great I did. I had
						parents of our team asking me why things were the way they were and I couldn't really explain it.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Our team made our way to Tier One Nationals in Saint Louis, Missouri after winning Regionals. This
						was the first time in orginization history and it was incredible to have been a part of that. Our accomplishment
						was even honored during the National Anthem at a Blue Jackets game, with all of us lined up on the blue line. 
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Although, I didn't get to play in Nationals as much as I would have wanted, I still look at it as an amazing event
						in my life. To say that we were one of sixteen teams in the United States to compete in Nationals is 
						truly amazing, and someting few can say.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Many of the players on my team went on to be successful. Two of them have even gone on to be drafted to the NHL.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						The most important take away from this experience was actually me. A bit odd to say I know, but it was incredible
						how far I had come in one year. My agility on the ice was honed, my sight for the puck as well as 
						situations unfolding on the ice were sharp, and my competitiveness was at an all time high. I was the best I could be.
						I am still proud of that.
