						I attended Worthington Kilbourne High School (WKHS) from 2006
						until 2010. It was here where I first began to realize who I was,
						how much I loved where I grew up, and made friendships that are 
						still going strong today.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Remembering this time in my life is more difficult than I
						feel it is for most people. I spent the first three years being
						very involved in ice hockey. At some points I missed school for
						weeks at a time, making it difficult to really socialize and have
						the traditional high school experience.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						However, my senior year was one for the books and I believe it was
						one of the best years of my life. My eyes were opened to the social
						life of high school, and I had the opportunity to get know the very few
						amount of people in the world that grew up in the same place at the same time
						as me.
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						Upon graduation in 2010, I had a difficult time deciding where to move on
						to college. Nearly all of my friends were heading to The Ohio State University
						(OSU), but I wanted to look beyond the Columbus area to see what Ohio had to offer. 
					</p>
					<p class = "contentText">
						It was a difficult decision, but I decided to venture two and a half hours
						to Oxford, Ohio and attend Miami University.
